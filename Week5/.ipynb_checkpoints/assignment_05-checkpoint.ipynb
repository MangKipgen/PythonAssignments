    "\n",
    "This will create a generic Student class that we will be able to extend with other class objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your Class should be able to create an Student object instance with the following properties\n",
    "\n",
    "- Construct with default attributes for School Name, Student First Name, and Last Name\n",
    "- Methods to update any of these above attributes\n",
    "- An overloaded method for the str() function to return the Student attributes in a string formatted sentence \"{FirstName} {LastName} is a student of {SchoolName}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "You are free to implement this class however you like. The testing code is included below. Don't be afraid to check the [documentation]('https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html') or any other resources you would like! Internet searching is a big part of promgramming"

Class flexibility is designed so that your approach reflects your own personal understanding of the problem. But for a more structured challenge read on...\n",
